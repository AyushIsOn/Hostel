# 📋 **DETAILED GitHub Pages Setup Guide**

## 🎯 **Enable GitHub Pages for Your Hostel Website**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository**
1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
2. **Go to**: https://github.com/AyushIsOn/Hostel
3. **Make sure you're signed in** to your GitHub account
4. **You should see your repository page** with files (if you've uploaded them)

### **Step 2: Access Repository Settings**
1. **Look at the top navigation bar** of your repository
2. **You'll see tabs**: `Code` | `Issues` | `Pull requests` | `Actions` | `Projects` | `Security` | `Insights` | `Settings`
3. **Click on "Settings"** (the rightmost tab)
   - ⚠️ **Important**: This is the repository Settings, not your profile settings
   - The Settings tab is only visible if you own the repository

### **Step 3: Find the Pages Section**
1. **On the Settings page**, look at the **left sidebar**
2. **Scroll down** in the left sidebar menu
3. **You'll see sections like**:
   - General
   - Access
   - Code and automation
   - Security
   - Integrations
   - Archives
4. **Under "Code and automation" section**, click **"Pages"**
   - It might be listed as just "Pages" in the sidebar

### **Step 4: Configure GitHub Pages**
1. **You're now on the Pages configuration page**
2. **Look for the "Source" section** (should be at the top)
3. **You'll see a dropdown menu** that currently says "None" or "Deploy from a branch"
4. **Click the dropdown** and you'll see options:
   - Deploy from a branch
   - **GitHub Actions** ← Select this one
5. **Click "GitHub Actions"**

### **Step 5: Save Configuration**
1. **After selecting "GitHub Actions"**, the page will update
2. **You might see a message** about GitHub Actions workflows
3. **No additional save button needed** - it saves automatically
4. **You should see a green checkmark** or success message

### **Step 6: Verify Setup**
1. **The page should now show**:
   - Source: **GitHub Actions** ✅
   - A note about using GitHub Actions workflows to build and deploy
2. **You might see**: "Your site is ready to be published at https://AyushIsOn.github.io/Hostel/"

## 🚀 **What Happens Next**

### **Automatic Deployment Process:**
1. **GitHub detects** the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository
2. **Actions tab will show** a workflow running (building your site)
3. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for the deployment to complete
4. **Green checkmark** means success!

### **Check Deployment Status:**
1. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your repository
2. **You'll see workflows running/completed**
3. **Green checkmark** = Website is live!
4. **Red X** = There was an error (check logs)

## 🌐 **Your Website URL**

Once deployment is complete, your website will be live at:
```
https://AyushIsOn.github.io/Hostel/
```

## 🔍 **Visual Guide - What You Should See:**

### **Repository Settings Page:**
```
GitHub Repository: AyushIsOn/Hostel
├── Code │ Issues │ Pull requests │ Actions │ Projects │ Security │ Insights │ Settings ←
│
└── Settings Page:
    ├── Left Sidebar:
    │   ├── General
    │   ├── Access
    │   ├── Code and automation
    │   │   └── Pages ← Click here
    │   ├── Security

```

Pages Settings:

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting:**

### **Can't find Settings tab?**
- Make sure you're on YOUR repository (AyushIsOn/Hostel)
- Make sure you're signed in to GitHub
